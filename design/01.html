                                The courtyard was silent, save for the soft murmur of wind brushing against the brick wall.
A stillness hung in the air—one that didn’t ask for attention, only patience.

Once, this might have been a place of passing glances, of wheels returning home, of everyday rhythm.
Now it waited, quietly, for something to begin again.

The shadows between the bike stands stretched longer than they used to, as if mourning time that had slipped by unnoticed.
Even the ground felt hushed, the tiles holding the weight of things left unsaid.

There’s a kind of romance in stillness—
in the way the world forgets a corner, and the corner learns to breathe on its own.
